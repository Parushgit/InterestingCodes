- If we have got just TreeNode* root and it has so many children. How do you build the adjacency list?

```
void buildGraph(Node* root, unordered_map<Node*, vector<Node*>>& graph) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;

    for (auto vec: root->children) {
        graph[root].push_back(vec);
        graph[vec].push_back(root);
        buildGraph(vec, graph);
    }
    return;
}
```

- Fill the set;

```
return nums.size() > set<int>(nums.begin(), nums.end()).size();

```

- Tree Traversals;

(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3 
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3 
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1

- Tokens in C++;

        istringstream ss(data);
        string token;
        while(getline(ss, token, ','))
            tokens.push_back(token);
            
            
- USe cases of Trie;

```
This article introduces the data structure trie. It could be pronounced in two different ways: as "tree" or "try". 
Trie which is also called a digital tree or a prefix tree is a kind of search ordered tree data structure mostly used for the efficient dynamic add/search operations with the strings.
Trie is widely used in real life: autocomplete search, spell checker, T9 predictive text, IP routing (longest prefix matching), some GCC containers.

Against hashmap();
Finding all keys with a common prefix.

Enumerating a dataset of strings in lexicographical order.

Scaling for the large datasets. Once the hash table increases in size, there are a lot of hash collisions and the search time complexity could degrade to \mathcal{O}(N^2 \cdot M)O(N 
2
 ⋅M), where NN is the number of the inserted keys.

Trie could use less space compared to hashmap when storing many keys with the same prefix. In this case, using trie has only \mathcal{O}(M \cdot N)O(M⋅N) time complexity, where MM is the key length, and NN is the number of keys.

- Sorting using comparator;
sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int> interval1, vector<int> interval2) { return interval1[0] < interval2[0]; });
