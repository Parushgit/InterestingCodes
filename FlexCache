Hi,

 

FlexCache® software scale out storage performance for read-heavy workloads. By caching only the data accessed, rather than entire volumes or files, FlexCache software:

1. Eliminates performance bottlenecks for read-intensive applications,even for multiple clients across multiple nodes    in a cluster, by enabling primary volumes under heavy load to be cached across the    cluster
2. Boosts storage efficiency and cost effectiveness by eliminating the need to provision for peak loads
3. Caches and serves hot datasets from anywhere in your clusterfor compute-intensive applications such as movie   rendering, chip-design, seismic analysis,and financial-markets simulation

FlexCache software can be added to existing FAS or V-Series systems running the clustered Data ONTAP® OS using NFSv3/4 or SMB 1.0/2.0/3.0.
